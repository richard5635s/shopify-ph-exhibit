A pop-up café offered exclusive confections and a capsule collection, while a monogram shaped like a three-leaf clover—an emblem of the three Hartanto sisters designed by the Bandung-based graphic design studio NUSAE—appeared throughout the space, hinting at the next identity for the brand.<br/><br/>The exhibition also included talk sessions with the Hartanto sisters and longtime collaborators. It served not only as a celebration of past achievements but as a platform to signal future plans, including a refreshed visual identity and continued focus on creating for modern women.</p>",
