Since the establishment in 2012, the brand has cultivated a strong visual identity that merges organic forms with whimsical and surrealist touches—creating clothing that speaks to modern femininity in all its complexity.<br/><br/>The design philosophy of PEGGY HARTANTO centers on the belief that women contain multitudes. This is expressed through bold silhouettes, vibrant color palettes, and imaginative details that offer both strength and softness. Each piece is meticulously constructed with an emphasis on fit and technique, resulting in ready-to-wear garments that are at once empowering, graceful, and unapologetically feminine.<br/><br/>With a foundation in craftsmanship and a spirit of reinvention, the brand continues to evolve across categories, including childrenswear and leather goods. Through each collection, PEGGY HARTANTO continues to reimagine the codes of modern femininity—and redefine what it means to dress with power and purpose.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>THE FOUNDERS<br/><br/></strong>Founded by sisters Peggy, Petty, and Lydia Hartanto, the brand began as a shared vision to create fashion collections that celebrate individuality and timeless design. Peggy serves as the Creative Director, drawing from her formal training at Raffles College of Design and Commerce in Sydney, Australia, while Petty acts as the Visual Director, and Lydia oversees the brand’s business development and operations as the Managing Director<br/><br/>Their combined skillset has earned PEGGY HARTANTO notable recognition on both regional and international stages. The brand was named in <em>Forbes Asia’s </em>30 Under 30: The Arts list in 2016, and was selected as a finalist for the International Woolmark Prize Asia in 2017. In 2023, it launched a special capsule collection to celebrate Disney’s 100th anniversary.<br/><br/>PEGGY HARTANTO is now available in select boutiques and retail spaces across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the United States, and continues to grow its global presence through curated collaborations and seasonal collections.</p>",
