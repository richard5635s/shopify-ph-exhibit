Sustainability is a long and ongoing journey, and for us this is our moral responsibility towards the planet that we live in and its people. We are committed to constantly putting effort to improve our contribution towards a circular economy.<br\/><br\/>PEOPLE<br\/><br\/>Our small team is based in Surabaya, Indonesia. We consist entirely of women, ranging vary from 20–65 years old from Surabaya and neighbouring towns. We commit to putting the welfare of our team as our priority in any business decision, since more than half of our staff is the breadwinner and supporting income in their households. We ensure everyone is qualified to get at least minimum standard salary,insurance, benefits, and opportunity to improve and grow in the company.<br\/><br\/>PRODUCTION<br\/><br\/>Besides producing what is pre-ordered by our retailers, we are minimizing overproduction and avoiding overstock by using pre-order system for your orders. We produce 70% of Peggy Hartanto garments in our workshop, which allowing full control over efficiency of this process.<br\/><br\/>GARMENT CARE<br\/><br\/>Due to the nature of the fabric and design, 80% of our garments are dry clean only.
