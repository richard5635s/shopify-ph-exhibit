However, sustainability is a long and ongoing journey, and we see it as our moral responsibility to the planet and its people. We are dedicated to continuously improving our contributions towards a circular economy.<br\/><br\/>PEOPLE<br\/><br\/>Our small team, based in Surabaya, Indonesia, consists entirely of women aged between 20 and 65 from Surabaya and neighboring towns. We are committed to prioritizing the welfare of our team in every business decision, as more than half of our staff are the primary breadwinners or support their households. We ensure that everyone receives at least the minimum standard salary, insurance, benefits, and opportunities for personal and professional growth within the company.<br\/><br\/>PRODUCTION<br\/><br\/>To minimize overproduction and avoid overstock, we produce garments based on pre-orders from our retailers and customers. Additionally, 50% of PEGGY HARTANTO garments are made in our workshop, allowing us to maintain full control over the efficiency of our production process.<br\/><br\/>GARMENT CARE<br\/><br\/>Due to the nature of our fabrics and designs, 80% of our garments require dry cleaning. Should your garment need repairs, our team is here to assist. If you are unable to visit our workshop, we can provide instructions for your trusted alteration or repair service. We hope you will cherish your PEGGY HARTANTO pieces for a long time. For more information, please contact us at <a>contact@peggyhartanto.com<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>SECOND LIFE<br\/><br\/>We are committed to promoting sustainability and extending the lifecycle of our garments. As part of this commitment, we encourage the resale of PEGGY HARTANTO pieces on trusted secondhand websites. By participating in the secondhand market, you contribute to a circular economy, reduce waste, and give our beautifully crafted garments a new life.<br\/><br\/>IMPROVEMENT<br\/><br\/>We fully recognize that our journey towards sustainability is ongoing, and we welcome all suggestions from our community on how we can improve our practices. Please share your thoughts with us at <a>lydia@peggyhartanto.com<\/a>. <\/p><p> <\/p>",
